# FIO

FIO (Flexible I/O Tester) is a powerful, open-source tool used for benchmarking and stress testing disk I/O performance on Linux and other UNIX-like operating systems, as well as Windows. It allows users to simulate various I/O workloads and measure key performance metrics like throughput, IOPS (I/O operations per second), and latency.

sudo apt update
```

Execute the following command to install FIO.
