# Hey, ho, let's Go

Tool built with Go:

- Kubernetes – Container orchestration platform for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
- Docker – The leading containerization engine for packaging and running applications.
- etcd – Distributed, reliable key-value store used by Kubernetes.
- Prometheus – Monitoring and alerting toolkit, widely used for metrics collection.
- Grafana – Analytics and monitoring platform (primary backend in Go).
- Consul – Service discovery, configuration, and segmentation tool.
- Terraform – Infrastructure-as-Code tool for provisioning and managing cloud resources.
- Vault – Secrets management system (from HashiCorp).
- Helm – Kubernetes package manager.
- Istio – Service mesh for managing microservices networking.
- Containerd – Industry standard container runtime.
- Podman and CRI-O – Container engines alternative to Docker, used in Kubernetes stacks.
- CoreDNS – DNS server and service discovery (used in Kubernetes by default).
- Argo CD – GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes.

## Installation

```bash
wget https://go.dev/dl/go1.21.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.21.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
go version
```

## Manage Packages

Initialize a module (recommended for all projects):

```bash
go mod init <module-name>
```

Add a dependency:

```bash
go get <package>
```

Update dependencies:

```bash
go get -u
```

Tidy up unused dependencies:

```bash
go mod tidy
```

## General File Structure for Modular Apps

```
myapp/
├── go.mod
├── main.go
├── pkg/
│   └── mylib.go
├── internal/
│   └── secret.go
└── README.md
```

- `go.mod`: Module definition and dependencies
- `main.go`: Entry point
- `pkg/`: Public libraries
- `internal/`: Private code (only accessible within this module)

## Compile and Run Projects

### Run

```bash
go run main.go
```

### Build

```bash
go build -o myapp main.go
```

### Install (to $GOPATH/bin)

```bash
go install
```
