# Ceph File-system

CephFS is a POSIX-compliant file system built on top of Cephâ€™s distributed object store (RADOS). It is designed for high performance, scalability, and availability, supporting use cases like shared directories, HPC scratch space, and distributed workflows.

Key features include:

* **Separation of data and metadata:** File metadata is stored in a dedicated RADOS pool and managed by a scalable cluster of Metadata Servers (MDS), while clients access file data directly from RADOS.
* **Scalable architecture:** Clients bypass intermediaries and interact directly with RADOS, allowing performance to scale with the underlying object store.
* **Efficient metadata handling:** Metadata updates are journaled in RADOS by MDSes without relying on local storage, enabling fast, coordinated access and modifications across clients.
