# :flushed: What is this?

**The Handbook** is my dedicated personal website for organizing and tracking my notes on various computer topics. It serves as a central hub where I can collect, categorize, and easily access my insights and learnings. From algorithms and data structures to software development practices and system architecture, it allows me to document my thoughts, share knowledge, and revisit important concepts whenever needed.

My goal is to create a comprehensive resource that reflects my journey in the field of computer, making it easier to find information and foster a deeper understanding of the subjects I am passionate about.

As an engineer, I've explored a wide range of topics and worked with countless tools and technologies. However, when I face a technical challenge, I often find myself turning to ChatGPT or Stack Overflow to recall specific commands, configurations, or techniques Iâ€™ve used before.

The Handbook solves this problem by providing a unified, searchable interface where I can store and quickly access personal notes, code snippets, setup instructions, debugging tips, and other valuable resources. It's essentially a personalized knowledge base that helps me retain and retrieve important information more efficiently, boosting my productivity and reducing time spent re-learning or re-searching things I already encountered.
