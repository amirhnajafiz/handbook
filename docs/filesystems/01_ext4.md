# Ext4

Ext4 stands for Fourth Extended Filesystem, the fourth major iteration of the EXT family used in Linux. On a normal Linux system, Ext4 support is already installed by default.

```sh
mkfs.ext4 -V
grep ext4 /proc/filesystems
```

Key features of Ext4:
- Journaling: Keeps a log (journal) of changes before applying them, which helps avoid corruption after power loss.
- Large file & volume support: Files up to 16TB, volumes up to 1 exabyte.
- Extents: Stores large contiguous blocks more efficiently than older systems.
- Backward compatibility: Can mount Ext3 and Ext2 filesystems.
- Delayed allocation: Groups small writes into bigger chunks to improve performance.
- Checksums: In the journal to detect corruption.

> Ext4 is default on most Linux distributions because it’s: Reliable, Well-supported, and Balanced between speed and safety.

## Usage

### Formatting a Disk or Partition with Ext4

If you have a raw disk or partition, you can format it:

```sh
sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb1
```

> Warning: This erases any existing data on /dev/sdb1.

### Mounting it

Once it’s formatted, you mount it to a directory so you can use it:

```sh
# list the disks
lsblk
# partition (optional)
sudo fdisk /dev/sdb
# mount
sudo mkdir /mnt/mydisk
sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/mydisk
```

Now `/mnt/mydisk` acts like a normal folder, but its contents are stored on that Ext4 filesystem.
