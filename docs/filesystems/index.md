# FileSystems

In computing, a file system -- sometimes written filesystem -- is a logical and physical system for organizing, managing and accessing the files and directories on a device's solid-state drive (SSD), hard-disk drive (HDD) or other media. Without a file system, the operating system (OS) would see only large chunks of data without any way to distinguish one file from the next. 

## How it works?

A file system stores and organizes data. It can be thought of as a type of index for all the data contained in a storage device. In addition to SSDs and HDDs, file systems are used for optical disks, flash drives and magnetic tape. Along with a file's content data, a file system maintains metadata about the files along with other information. The metadata might include details such as the file size, creation date or location in the directory.

## Architecture

File systems handle both the physical and logical operations associated with managing files. Although they take different approaches to storing file data, they commonly separate metadata from the file's content data. They also store a small amount of other data types, which are used for maintaining the file system and facilitating file access.

## Types

- File Allocation Table (FAT)
- exFAT

- Resilient File System (ReFS)
- Extended filesystem (ext)
- B-tree filesystem (Btrfs)
- Global File System (GFS)
- Hierarchical file system (HFS)
- HDFS
- NFS
