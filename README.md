The Handbook is a web application I built to organize and store useful materials related to computer science and engineering.

As an engineer, I've explored a wide range of topics and worked with countless tools and technologies. However, when I face a technical challenge, I often find myself turning to ChatGPT or Stack Overflow to recall specific commands, configurations, or techniques Iâ€™ve used before.

The Handbook solves this problem by providing a unified, searchable interface where I can store and quickly access personal notes, code snippets, setup instructions, debugging tips, and other valuable resources. 

It's essentially a personalized knowledge base that helps me retain and retrieve important information more efficiently, boosting my productivity and reducing time spent re-learning or re-searching things I already encountered.
